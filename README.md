# Weather
Weather is a project to work on my use of markup and styling (HTML & CSS) along with a refresher of Javascript with APIs.
Eventually I would like to use jQuery for this project, but that is for a different day. I am currently working on the
website to be viewed from a large screen, and eventually will work around to making it optomized for mobile-liked devices.
Future projects to expand on would be a Chrome Extensions and/or App. This project is not generating revenue and is just
being used to build my skills. I hope you enjoy!
## What's going on here?
This project is currently using two APIs, [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) for weather 
data and [Big Data Cloud](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/) for reverse geocoding. I am extremely thankful for these services as
without them, this project would not be possible. After the user grants the location access, weather data is found via *Open-Meteo API*
and the geolocation pins a city with *Big Data Cloud API*. From there, the program will update the data on the page accordingly.
## Future of the project
This is a relatively new project, and I will try to update this as I continue work on it:
- [x] Fix `Undefined Errors` regarding the feels like temp and humdity (index error)
- [ ] Weekly Forecast
- [ ] Search for city
- [ ] Mobile Viewing
- [ ] Dark Mode
- [ ] Other Pages
- [ ] Chrome Extension?
- [ ] App?
