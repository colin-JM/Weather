# Weather
Weather is a project to work on my use of markup and styling (HTML & CSS) along with a refresher of Javascript with APIs.
Eventually I would like to use jQuery for this project, but that is for a different day. I am currently working on the
website to be viewed from a large screen, and eventually will work around to making it optomized for mobile-liked devices.
Future projects to expand on would be a Chrome Extensions and/or App. This project is not generating revenue and is just
being used to build my skills. I hope you enjoy!
###Live Build Website
You can view the live website on my repl page here:
> (weather.colinjm.repl.co)[https://weather.colinjm.repl.co/]
`The website may not be live if it hasn't been opened recently by me. In addition, mobile viewing is not supported as of 1/10/2023.`
## What's going on here?
This project is currently using two APIs, [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) for weather 
data and [Big Data Cloud](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/) for reverse geocoding. I am extremely thankful for these services as
without them, this project would not be possible. After the user grants the location access, weather data is found via *Open-Meteo API*
and the geolocation pins a city with *Big Data Cloud API*. From there, the program will update the data on the page accordingly.
## Future of the project
This is a relatively new project, and I will try to update this as I continue work on it:
- [x] Fix `Undefined Errors` regarding the feels like temp and humdity (index error)
- [X] Weekly Forecast
- [X] Hourly Temp Graph
- [ ] Search for city
- [ ] Hourly Temp Graph per Selected Day
- [ ] Mobile Viewing
- [ ] Dark Mode
- [ ] Other Pages
- [ ] Chrome Extension?
- [ ] App?
## Installation
This code can be run instantly in whatever IDE you chose. You do not need to include the `.replit` and `replit.nix` files.
The purpose of these files is to run the code on the Replit online IDE, easily view/share the site, and update this page.
